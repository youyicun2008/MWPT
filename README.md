# MWPT
MWPT-IHHI (the denoising method by combining a multi-threshold wavelet packet transform and an improved Hilbert-Huang transform) makes use of WPT and HHT method for microseismic signals from a coal seam hydraulic fracturing.

The package comes as a collection of 4 modules: 

1. FSWT (microseismic signal in the time and frequency domain).

2. RickerWave (generate synthetic signals in conjunction with white Gaussian noise). 

3. MWPT (multi-threshold wavelet packet transform). 

4. Data (microseismic data were obtained from a coal mine in China).
