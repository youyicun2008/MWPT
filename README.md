# MWPT
MWPT-IHHI (the denoising method by combining a multi-threshold wavelet packet transform and an improved Hilbert-Huang transform) makes use of WPT and HHT method for microseismic signals from a coal seam hydraulic fracturing.

The package comes as a collection of 4 folders: 
FSWT (microseismic signal in the time and frequency domain).
RickerWave (generate synthetic signals in conjunction with white Gaussian noise). 
MWPT (multi-threshold wavelet packet transform). 
Data (microseismic data were obtained from a coal mine in China).
